    </p>
       <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Appearance</strong></p>
    <span class="infotext">Dante stands in at around 6’6” and weighs in at 216 lbs, with a physique equivalent to that of an Olympic gymnast at their prime. He possesses hair as white as pristine snow that extends to just past his chin, bangs parted from his right eye -said
      orbs are a piercing ice blue that combine with his generally blank-to-irritated expression to give off the obvious air and demeanor of a man that has seen enough and will tolerate nothing further. He sports a square jaw, strong and somewhat pronounced,
      and a narrow forehead. His body is immaculate, the reformation of his body removing any and all irregularities he used to possess - as a result, he doesn’t appear to be any older than his mid- to late-30s. His skin tone has gotten darker since his
      ‘ascension’, taking on a pigmentation closer to an orange hue that amazingly hides otherwise visible veins and the like. His body is so perfectly formed that it loops back around and gives away his inherently unnatural heritage.</span>
       <span class="infotext">His attire, while it is changed to suit his current serious outlook, still wears the trademark crimson that allows him to keep the name ‘Redgrave’ even after all this time; Dante has one set of attire he wears both out in public and in the confines of
        his office, so much so that one would not be faulted for thinking it was his <em>only</em> clothing. His coat has changed to that of a deeper shade of red that serves as a contrast to his unnaturally striking eyes, with the front torso
        area outright different from the rest: it is made of a flexible dark leather that connects to the buckled black collar of his top. He wears it zipped up to just below the collarbone, leaving the skin exposed from there. He also has a black leather
        strap wrapping around to his back over and under the right shoulder, with two golden studs in the front; this is likely where Dante’s sword is attached to. He wears denim-style pants the same shade of red as his jacket with a belt strapped securely
        to each thigh, likely connecting to the holsters hidden beneath the twin tails of his coat, and black riding boots. The pants are held up with a skull-buckled belt, the design on which seems to hover between that of a human cranium and a demonic
        head. On his hands he wears strapped leather gloves that completely encompass his fingers and even some of the arm up past the wrists.</span>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Personality</strong></p>
    <span class="infotext">Dante seems to have lost much of his cocky attitude and has become much more stoic, being far more serious about matters than he usually was. During the few times where he does interact with others he is very blunt and callous, calling things
      as he sees them and wasting little time with merely beating around the bush. His overly direct methodology is reflected even in the way he fights; he uses firearms even more than usual to simply execute his marks and get on with his unending life,
      only ever drawing Rebellion when something is a little too big to just gun down.</span>
        <span class="infotext">Attitude and personality, however, are two different spectrums of the persona. As initially uncaring and mistrusting as he is, Dante still has a predisposition towards going after perpetrators as opposed to just everyone. If he ever finds that a mark
        is harmless both in present and future he will almost always ignore them and let them be on their way. It is not quite known if this is his inherent human kindness or merely him not wanting to deal with unnecessary annoyances, but nonetheless
        the ‘innocent’ are always spared. For those that happen to become his acquaintances he treats them with just a tad more respect and attention than strangers, but ultimately does not show or feel deeper attachment to them. He is a very stubborn
        individual; he makes a decision, nothing short of incredibly powerful mind-control can change that.</span>
<span class="infotext">He has a habit of flipping a coin when he is at a significant crossroads in a situation; this is his only remaining moral barrier keeping him from becoming like any other demon.</span>
  </div>
<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
  <p style="text-align: center;">  <span class="infotext">
    Even in his youth Dante possessed strength beyond that of humans and most demons - now, with his advanced age, he is leagues beyond even his father in terms of power. At his weakest he can hold a large vehicle over his head indefinitely, and at his
      strongest he can overpower massive devils like the skyscraper-sized Nefasturris. The sheer amount of energy his body can both deliver and take means that he is one hell of a powerhouse, capable of performing Herculean feats without so much as a
      sweat or fear of injury or fatigue. He can survive for exceptionally long periods of time without food or supplies, and the lengths at which he has done so hint at his ability to last forever on what power his body contains alone. Dante is also
      capable of withstanding extreme levels of heat and subzero temperatures for a comparably long stretch of time, can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and is fast enough to dodge bullets shot at point-blank ranges.</span>
<p style="text-align:center"><span class="infotext">His unfathomable level of power is partly thanks to his greater still level of cellular regeneration, powered by his demonic heritage and accelerated to points where moderate wounds heal as soon as they are inflicted; he can function without missing a
        beat even if there were numerous energy-draining blades stabbed through him. This regenerative process is well layered, a passive portion of his nervous system detecting and mending what qualifies as superficial wounds in the grand scheme of his
        well being, keeping pain from affecting his trains of thought. He is nearly immune to toxic atmosphere, normal poisoning, diseases and even aging; physically, he is immortal to the point where he not only retains his age but also his physical
  state.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><span class="infotext">
  His training, experience and natural affinities has rendered his mind a veritable fortress without much effort; he is mostly immune to attempts at mind control or subtle influences, as well as most illusory attempts. His perception is similarly uncanny, able to see the slightest of movements or disturbances in the air with the naked eye alone - with his demonic power, however, he can outright see apparitions or at the very least their lingering trails from before they passed to their final resting place. He can sense just about anything with demonic presences from a considerable distance away, and upon focusing can sense even the absolute weakest of traces.</span>
  </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span class="infotext">
Dante has such a plethora of combat experience that he splits his thought processes into various 'styles' that allow him to focus on only a single aspect of battle. This is hardly a drawback to him, as he can switch between them as easily as he can breathe.</span>
  </p>
    <strong>Trickster</strong>
<span class="infotext">A combat style that allows Dante to dance, dash, and disappear all along the battleground as untouchable as a phantom. Counter-maneuvers are regulated effectively towards instinct, using his vast array of experience for the few moments where he isn’t prepared for something - though for the most part, this is hardly triggered. Dante’s mind is plenty  complex enough to receive and interpret  information from his senses near instantly, giving him plenty of time to react  accordingly.</span>
<span class="infotext">With this style he can perform pseudo-teleports over short distances, granting him the advantage of getting the drop on an enemy even within the very midsts of intense close quarters combat, and in combination with the array of powers granted by utilizing the less stringent laws of physics granted by having a  shadow copy he can dodge attacks entirely even if that same attack already hit him. In such an instance he simply shoves himself aside by near-instantaneously replacing his own being with that of shadow mass, the force that comes from such a replacement serving to propel him away from the direction of the attack.</span>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gunslinger</strong>
  <span class="infotext">Perhaps one of the only styles that maintains the original flair he used to possess. Gunslinger style allows him to turn simple aiming and shooting to a veritable circus act, throwing and flinging his weapons around in perfect gunkatas. Even with the constant movement of his weaponry he can still hit targets with precision accuracy - now he can just hit multiple targets at once even when surrounded.</span>
<span class="infotext">Though this is not the only advantage to this style; he also uses his demonic power to directly modify the very constitution of a weapon, reinforcing and reconfiguring his arsenal to points where it should be borderline physically impossible to do certain things: a prime example is him using a revolver and firing all six shots at once like a shotgun. This prevents him from using normal weapons anymore - however, he has a large enough catalog of custom-made weaponry to avoid that issue.</span>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Swordmaster</strong>
  <span class="infotext">Dante is a master of the sword, swinging around claymores like they were daggers - Swordmaster, however, makes even professional fencers lose all sense of self-confidence and esteem. He is able to move like he has eyes in the back of his head, striking enemies from behind with the same effort used to swat at a fly before going right back into slicing and dicing with precision and accuracy without missing a beat. He also possesses something of a telekinetic heft on whatever weapon he uses, combining his command of power with actual telekinesis to call weapons to him even from great distances.</span>
<span class="infotext">
He can channel his energy through Devil Arms to unlock more of their elemental affinities, bringing about an entirely new game to a fight to hit demons where it hurts more. His sense of control also reflects through the way he uses his weapons, throwing out elemental wrath in the same breaths as actually attacking.</span>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Royalguard</strong>
  <span class="infotext">Dante makes a conscious effort to let his energy exude centimeters from him before regulating the resulting barrier to a passive state - from then on, he is protected further from damage with his Royalguard style. The energy is somewhat meager in comparison to what he can output, but compensates by focusing all energy into the points of impact. However, once he focuses his attention on blocking any particular method of blocking he puts out even more energy to completely nullify anything that comes his way. The more punishment dealt to him in either case, the more that kinetic energy is stored within the barrier and the more punishment Dante can take.</span>
<span class="infotext">From that point he can either take that energy and expel it with massive amounts of force back towards his assailant, heavily weakining their own defenses, or use it to form an demon exoskeleton that, while it limits his movement, is nigh impregnable.</span>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Quicksilver</strong>
  <span class="infotext">A style that actually requires a bit more effort on Dante’s end to utilize - but it is instantly made up for with the mere fact that it is a temporal alteration combat state. Quicksilver allows him to use the inherent ‘strangeness’ of his demonic heritage in tandem with his own vast power to create particles that emit time-slowing fields, before releasing it all at once either through a radial burst or a more focused flash-burst. Both slow the areas of effect to a crawl to the point where a high-caliber bullet moves about as fast as a snail, though the focus burst slows the adversary down further still.</span>
<span class="infotext">As a passive effect of even possessing this style, Dante is immune to to similar temporal powers even down to the point of paradoxes occuring. His body will change according to what occurs in his timeline to change it, but his constituent parts as well as his powers and abilities remain the same; Devil Trigger bypasses all this outright, allowing him to retain his original devil body regardless of paradoxes.</span>
  <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Doppelganger</strong>
  <span class="infotext">Dante has come a startlingly long way with this style, originally a mere supplement to his past skill now effectively his own personal knight. His thoughts are linked perfectly with the subordinate Doppelganger, which resides within a personal pocket of the demon realm linked to Dante and manifests through his shadow - as a result it obeys his every mental command as soon as it comes, whether it be through following his actions or attacking independent of his own physical actions to overwhelm an adversary. Its shadowy mass is a peculiarity: while it can strike every bit as hard as Dante himself, it has far less physical resilience - however, this is made up with through the fact that it is much more malleable, able to keep attacking at optimal speeds even when there are weapons lodged inside of it that would serve as a hindrance even to Dante.</span>
<spab class="infotext">His shadow is not the limits of his ability to summon the doppelganger; if he was in complete darkness, he could summon multiples of the creatures to assist him.</span>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>REBELLION</strong> <sub><em>The Legendary Devil Bane</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">Originally it was a keepsake from his father - now it is his own personal weapon, bound to the very essence that defines Dante as He. It is a literal extension of himself, and thus he can summon it at any time and from any location, eliminating the
      need to hide it from public eye through external methods.<br/><br/> Similarly, because of this unbreakable bond and extension of the self, Rebellion is perfectly adept at releasing his true power without a bit of effort on Dante’s end; former moves
      such as Drive are Round Trip are trivialized to simple swipes of the weapon. Outside of his hands, it is a claymore that is impossible to lift from the ground let alone use, even by those that share his blood.<br/><br/>
      As it is connected to his very soul, he can manifest the blade into an utterly indestructible humanoid form that takes the appearance of a <a href="http://static.tumblr.com/3ea72089bf0482eb30f8a9752a5a1c64/nevot7q/cBDmpdbre/tumblr_static_537567-a6876c01a33bb8c4e5a42166556c2fca.jpg" target="blank">crimson-haired woman.</a> So long as Dante lives, it will remain in whatever state he directs.

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>CERBERUS</strong> <sub><em>The Ice Guardian</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">A tripartite nunchaku chiseled from the soul of Temen-ni-gru’s ice guardian. The chains that keep the weapon together can unlock from one another and extend to any length its user chooses, all connected by the very bond that keeps a soul together.
      Its power is as icy cold as the guardian it was taken from, capable of generating endless amounts of subzero frost and siphoning the heat of molten rock in seconds.<br/><br/> Those incapable of taming this beast suffer a never-ending torment of
      chill, frozen for all eternity by the very power the sought and failed to control. Release is greatly lusted after, but the bite of Cerberus keeps all fire from saving them.</span>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AGNI&#47;RUDRA</strong> <sub><em>The Firestorm</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">Twin serrated scimitar comprised of the minds of two cordial gatekeepers; the Fire is appropriately hued, as is the Storm. Separately they are mere weapons of intense fire and cutting winds, but together they are the Firestorm: the relentless rending
      of flesh, scorching of wound, and reopening of old wounds never to see an end. <br/><br/> The unworthy fall victim to the maelstrom of evisceration; those unfortunate enough not to be torn to nothingness by the Firestorm are enslaved by the demon
      blades to serve as a host body, their souls never seeing salvation for the rest of its days.</span>
  </div>

    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/rnySh0J.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>NEVAN</strong> <sub><em>The Sorceress of the Abyss</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">The chordophone birthed from the very womb of the Lightning Witch, the sorceress of The Abyss, the Opera’s Songstress. Its seductive tones lure the weak into the guillotine of its embrace, granting the victim one last jolt of ecstasy before their
      demise. For the distant they are accosted with the liberating bite of her wicked angels, sucked dry of their vital essence and leaving little more than a carcass unfit for even a vulture to feed upon.<br/><br/> Suffice it to say, those incapable
      of satisfying this succubus of a witch become one of these very victims.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/q8Yt63j.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>BEOWULF</strong> <sub><em>The Lightbeast</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">Fashioned from the limbs of the Lightbeast and fueled by his insurmountable rage, these armaments of gauntlet and greave grant its wielder the capacity of a ‘blink bruiser’ - a brawler that can flash from enemy to enemy with all the power of one beset
      with Wrath. A luminescence that burns deeper than flesh, reaches further than the naked eye, and strikes wholly with the mass of a steel volley, it is a weapon befitting of a true master.<br/><br/> As for those finding themselves overcome with the
      blinding desire for revenge in this soul, they are doomed to follow in the footsteps of this Lightbeast, to fight and maim and kill until there is nothing left for them to fight with.</span>
  </div>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ALASTOR</strong> <sub><em>The Spirit of Lightning</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">A blade with both spirit and mind still intact and functional; only those worthy of it can take control of its power over the roar of the sky, the fang of the darkcast: lightning. As befitting its heft on lightning it grants the user the ability to
      tap into their reflexive strength and hone it into a proper weapon, striking quickly and many before their foes have a chance to blink. It also powers one’s hidden potential, allowing them to bring it out in full and become a knight of the sky.<br/><br/>      All others will be enslaved by its will, becoming little more than a vessel for its power; the soul itself is amplified to feel every last bit of electricity coursing through its being, doomed to suffer until the end of its usefulness.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/bAkeCd9.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>IFRIT</strong> <sub><em>The Gauntlet of Flame</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">The explosive burn of these fists are those of the hellfire serpent, the Dragon of the Dark. Its control of hellfire is a sight to behold, able to melt and destroy all things foolish enough to stand against it. While its power destroys those it is
      used against, the dragon’s master remains forever unharmed and uninhibited; it is but an extension of their own prowess.<br/><br/> But there is a test its master must pass, and if they fail they are shackled by the gauntlets themselves and burned
      until it is but a cast of hot coal.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/o96HHVB.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SPARDA</strong> <sub><em>The Legendary Dark Knight</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">Long sought after by demon and human alike, and finally in the possession of the one most qualified: the last son of the blade’s master himself. It has the uncanny ability to morph soul and form to suit its owner’s needs of combat; a scythe, spear,
      sword and shield are but a few of the forms it can take. As its history has seen numerous wielders until this point, Dante has made himself the ‘guardian’ of this weapon to ensure it cannot be used for evil again.<br/><br/> To ensure this, he has
      ripped his half of the amulet back out from the weapon to render its power dormant; Dante himself is now its guardian.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/Oasmlwy.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GILGAMESH</strong> <sub><em>The Shock Steel</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">Forged of a metal found only within the demon world, which is also said to have been the by-product of an ancient hero’s very flesh. This weapon set aligns itself with the nervous system of the user, sharpening their perception to where they can turn
      their brutal blows into succinct slices. The more flesh is torn asunder, the more that matter is absorbed into it to strengthen density and raw energy.<br/><br/> Of course this is as double-edged a blade as one can find. This is a weapon that lures
      in many with a seemingly safe source of power, but the more this weapon is used by those incapable of sustaining it, the more their own flesh is used to feed it.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZOW9v5W.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PANDORA</strong> <sub><em>The Calamitous Ordnance</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">The legend of the foolish woman that disobeyed orders and opened the box of omen is anything but, and the box was housed in the ‘safety’ of Hell so as to keep other humans from making the same mistake she did. The box can form into 666 different weapons
      and is powered by the chaos each unleashes; there is not a being in the universe that can fuel the metaphysical evils of the world, not even its current owner - as such, its use is quite limited.<br/><br/> Should one be careless and choose to use
      the 666th form without closing it back immediately...</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/qPJfZNZ.png?1" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>LUCIFER</strong> <sub><em>The Inexhaustible Sword</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">From the weapon whose namesake hails from the devil of Pride comes an unending cache of penetrating blades. All but its user are pierced by this weapon’s darts, and upon command will detonate and explode with tremendous force. As it is a weapon tethered
      to the mental direction of its user they can trail behind them, appear within an instant around the intended target, and when detonated at once will chain into a devastating explosion.<br/><br/> The weak of mind will succumb to the influence of
      this weapon, driven mad and attacking everyone and everything in sight with no control over their own blades.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/2zdtVLk.png" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>VENDETTA</strong> <sub><em>The HEAT Striker</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">The first success in a long line of artificial devil weaponry. Dante possesses the prototype of the Vendetta ICWS, and is able to channel his power through spatial compressors that bypass normal physical properties to destroy any type of protective
      materials. The blades upon the gloves and boots serve as a rail system in an A.P.P. (accelerated particle projector) system, adding lethal long-range capability to an already vicious CQC capacity.<br/><br/> Dante in particular has displayed the
      ability to channel massive amounts of power through the regulated charging system and release it in a sustained blast that rips through anything in his path.</span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img class="weapon" src="http://i.imgur.com/dNRxQmC.png?1" width="100px">
    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>MERCILESS</strong> <sub><em>The Soul Reaver</em></sub></p>
    <span class="weapontext">A component of a now-deactivated siphoning system created to regulate the power of Argosax, repurposed by Dante into a ranged bladed weapon. Merciless is a glaive weapon made out of tungsten and fused together with base devil essence, tethered to
      a device locked onto his hand. It has become a weapon capable of directly stealing the energy from a living being and converting it into energy required by whatever system it is connected to - in this case, replenishing Dante’s expended devil energy.<br/><br/>      Dante also uses it as a tether whenever it becomes lodged into something, warping himself to the weapon and proceeding to wrench it out of the object - or person, or demon - with enough force to tear out a good chunk of it. Or simply tear the demon
      apart.</span>
  </div>

</div>
<div id="tab-6" class="tab-content">
  <p>Dante has awakened his true demonic self decades ago, and now he is only a half-breed through circumstance of birth; for all intents and purposes otherwise, he is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3hj4XMq.png" target="blank">full-blooded devil</a>.  As a result there is little difference in his power in terms of both strength and speed - it is all entirely based upon the physical state of each - and he can remain in this form indefinitely. His telekinetic heft on his weaponry is near-absolute with the direct access to his power.</p>


<p>In his devil form he can withstand far more punishment without taking damage at all. His skin replaced with a durable, bulletproof carapace, and while his flesh is slightly more exposed as a result of the joints within the key areas of his unnatural protection, is stronger overall because of the complete unlock of energy output; he constantly exudes demonic energy with no effort on his end, and this extends through to his styles and their usages of his energy. Trickster style has him right on the barrier of the human realm and the shadow realm, Gunslinger and Swordmaster constantly siphons energy through to the respective weapons, Royalguard’s limitations on the demon armor are removed entirely as his carapace is already a natural armor, Quicksilver style is automatically triggered when he is in top shape, Doppelganger style has the greatest augment however, in which the shadowy doppelganger becomes a perfect replica of his demon state and can use the same projectile-based attacks that he can.</p>

<p>Most important of all is the addition of wings, which allows him to fly. With the constant exuding of energy he can levitate for as long as he remains in his Triggered state, and can even perform wing-based attacks without the use of a Devil Arm. </p>
